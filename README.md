Simple freetime ram editor for a game noone cares about anymore. I don't know why starting this project was a good idea since I'm pretty busy, we'll see how far this project goes.  
I literally made this entire repo just because I wanted a place to save pointers and not have to use Noexs every time I wanted to edit ram for this game.
